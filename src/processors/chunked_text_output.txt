**What loss or damage is insured in terms of time?**

## Part A
**Underlying Provisions of the Insurance Contract**  
### A1 Scope of the contract  
The policy specifies the type of product, insurance and coverage options that have been purchased. Only those coverages specified in the policy are insured. The policy, these General Insurance Conditions (GIC), any Supplementary Conditions (SC) and any Special Insurance Conditions (SIC) mentioned in the policy provide information about the scope of the insurance.
The insurance covers events that occur during the term of the contract. The term of the contract is specified in the policy. AXA provides the vehicle legal protection insurance on behalf and for the account of AXA-ARAG.  
### A2 Territorial scope  
#### A2.1 Scope of validity  
The insurance is valid for Europe and countries bordering the Mediterranean, but it does not include the Russian Federation, Crimea, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Syria or Kazakhstan.
See also the countries marked in gray on the map at the end of these GIC.
The scope of validity of the insurance for "Roadside assistance including onward travel" is set out in D3.2.  
#### A2.2 Relocation abroad  
If the keeper registers their departure with the Swiss authorities and/or moves abroad (except, in either case, to the Principality of Liechtenstein), the insurance coverage lapses at the end of the insurance year at the latest. At the request of the policyholder, the contract may also be terminated earlier. If the vehicle or the trailer is registered abroad or the location of the trailer is moved abroad, the insurance coverage lapses immediately.  
### A3 Term of the contract  
#### A3.1 Beginning  
The insurance contract begins on the date specified in the policy and applies to loss or damage and legal cases that arise during the term of the contract. Any provisional insurance coverage that may be in place expires once the policy is issued.
We can reject your quote or application to take out insurance. Any provisional insurance coverage that may be in place ends three days after you receive notice of such rejection. In this case, you will owe the pro rata premium for the period of coverage.  
#### A3.2 Provisional coverage from the date of vehicle registration  
From the date the vehicle is registered until a quote or application is submitted, we provide partial or comprehensive accidental damage coverage for up to 30 days (CHF 1 000 deductible for collision), provided that an application is submitted during this period for insurance that includes coverage for the loss or damage incurred.
Provisional coverage for comprehensive accidental damage insurance is granted for vehicles up to and including their 7th year of operation and for partial accidental damage insurance, for vehicles up to and including their 15th year of operation. Compensation is provided at present value and is limited to a maximum amount of CHF 200 000.  
In addition, this provisional coverage does not apply if the driver's license of the driver of the vehicle has been revoked for more than two months in the last 36 months.  
#### A3.3 Provisional coverage from the date of submission of the quote or application  
If a quote or application is submitted to us, we will provide provisional coverage until the policy is issued. This covers the benefits provided for in the quote or application, but up to a maximum of:
- the minimum amount guaranteed by law under liability insurance
- CHF 200 000 under accidental damage insurance
- CHF 10 000 vehicle legal protection
- CHF 100 000 disability lump sum under accident insurance
- CHF 20 000 lump sum death benefit  
If the quote or application is rejected, insurance coverage lapses three days after you receive notice to this effect. The premium is owed on a pro rata basis for the period during which provisional coverage is in effect.  
#### A3.4 Contract renewal  
The contract is concluded for the term specified in the policy, after which it is automatically renewed for another year. A contract concluded for less than one year ends on the date specified in the policy.  
### A4 Termination of the contract  
#### A4.1 Ordinary termination  
Either contracting party (you or we) may terminate the contract in writing or in another form of text (e-mail, for example) up to three months prior to its expiry.
If the term of the contract is longer than three years, you or we may terminate it at the end of the third year or each subsequent year thereafter in writing or in another form of text (e-mail, for example), subject to compliance with a period of notice of three months.  
---  
*Motor Vehicle Insurance. GIC Version 10.2023*
### A4.2 Termination in the event of a claim  
After a claim or legal case for which we provide benefits, the contract may be terminated as follows:  
- By you: no later than 14 days after you become aware of the payment of the benefit or, in the case of vehicle legal protection, after the last service was provided, with coverage ending 14 days following receipt by us of the notice of termination.
- By us: at the latest on disbursement of the benefit or provision of the last service through the legal protection insurance, with coverage ending 14 days following receipt by you of the notice of termination.  
### A4.3 Termination by you in the event of an adjustment to the contract by us  
A11.2 applies.  
---  
### A5 Surrender of license plates  
**A5.1** If you surrender the license plates to the competent authority (e.g. department of motor vehicles), the insurance remains valid for 12 months from the date of surrender (e.g. if the automobile is stolen from your garage). There is no insurance coverage on public roads.  
**A5.2** If the license plates are surrendered for a period of at least 14 days, the premium for this period will be credited as soon as the plates are re-registered (suspension discount). In this case, a processing fee (suspension fee) will be applied. There is no coverage for vehicle legal protection while the license plates are surrendered.  
**A5.3** If you agreed to a waiver of the surrender of the license plates in the policy (e.g. in the case of motorcycles), the license plates may not be surrendered. In amendment of A5.2, no suspension discount is granted if you nevertheless surrender the license plates. The suspension fee is owed, however.  
---  
### A6 Transfer of the insurance to a replacement vehicle  
**A6.1** If the competent authority (e.g. department of motor vehicles) approves a replacement vehicle in place of the insured vehicle, the insurance is transferred to the replacement vehicle. Accidental damage coverage and the services and add-ons for the replacement vehicle are valid for a maximum of 30 consecutive days.  
**A6.2** Accidental damage coverage is valid for a replacement vehicle of the same value, and it continues to be valid for the replaced vehicle except for any "collision" accidental damage event.  
---  
### A7 Use of interchangeable license plates  
**A7.1** If one of the vehicles with no license plate or pair of license plates is used on public roads, it will not be covered.  
**A7.2** In the event of a change from interchangeable plates to individual plates, the vehicle excluded from the contract is covered as if the license plates had been surrendered (A5.1), provided that the keeper or owner of the vehicle does not change.  
---  
### A8 Premium payment  
**A8.1 Amount and due date of the premium**  
The premium specified in the policy or premium statement is due on the first day of each insurance year; the due date for the first premium is specified in the statement. In the event of payment by installments, the installments due during the insurance year are deemed to be deferred. We may add a surcharge for each installment.  
**A8.2 Default in payment and consequences of default**  
If the premium, processing fees, reminder fees or deductibles are not paid following a written reminder, we will set a 14-day extension of deadline. If you fail to meet this deadline, your coverage will be suspended (interruption of coverage). If liability is insured in the contract, we are required to inform the responsible department of motor vehicles, following which your license plates will be confiscated.  
Once the outstanding premiums, deductibles and all fees such as reminder fees or costs such as the costs of confiscation of the license plates have been paid in full, the insurance contract will be reinstated. The date of the payment is decisive for the reinstatement of the insurance coverage. You will not receive retroactive insurance coverage for the period of interruption. If the department of motor vehicles was already notified of the interruption of coverage, you will need a new certificate of insurance.  
The insurance contract will lapse two months following the 14-day extended deadline set in the reminder letter, unless we take legal steps to demand payment of the outstanding premium (debt enforcement).  
We can arrange with the department of motor vehicles for confiscation of the license plates if you do not pay  
- the premium,
- the deductible,
- other amounts owed such as reminder fees,
- or if any other legal or contractual provisions allow confiscation.

--- Chunk 5 ---
The same no claims discount system (table with increasing and decreasing levels) applies to both liability insurance and "collision" events under accidental damage coverage, but the claims levels are calculated separately for each.  
| A9.1 | No claims level in % | Discount in % |
|------|---------------------|--------------|
|      | 150                 |              |
|      | 130                 |              |
|      | 120                 |              |
|      | 110                 |              |
|      | 100                 |              |
|      |  90                 | 10           |
|      |  80                 | 20           |
|      |  75                 | 25           |
|      |  70                 | 30           |
|      |  65                 | 35           |
|      |  60                 | 40           |
|      |  55                 | 45           |
|      |  50                 | 50           |
|      |  45                 | 55           |
|      |  40                 | 60           |
|      |  36                 | 64           |
|      |  33                 | 67           |
|      |  30                 | 70           |  
Example: If your policy/premium statement shows you have a no claims level of 30 %, you are eligible for a discount of 70 %.  
**A9.2** The level and thus the premium are recalculated for each insurance year. The determining factor is whether any claim was filed in the preceding 12-month period up to the three months before the end of the insurance year (observation period).  
**A9.3** In the absence of any claims, the no claims level for the following insurance year is reduced by one level. If the insurance begins less than six months prior to the end of the insurance year, the no claims level will remain unchanged in the next insurance year.  
**A9.4** For each claim, the no claims level for the following insurance year will increase by four levels in the insurance (liability or collision) affected by it.  
**A9.5** The premium level for liability coverage does not increase:
- if we are required to pay benefits even though the insured is not at fault (simple causal liability)
- in the event of joyriding (pursuant to the Road Traffic Act), provided that the keeper is not at fault for the misappropriation of the vehicle  
**A9.6** For liability and collision, the level is corrected retroactively if:
- no benefits are paid out for an event that has been reported
- a liable party or their insurer paid the full amount in liability compensation as part of a final settlement for collision damage (accidental damage)
- you repay the benefits paid by us within 30 days of your having been notified of the settlement  
**A9.7** Bonus protection (no increase of the no claims level); see D2  
**A9.8** Your no claims level is set out in the policy when the contract is concluded. Your premium statement will provide you with information on the currently valid level and the resulting premium.

--- Chunk 6 ---
**A10.1 General**  
For every event for which we pay benefits, you pay the deductible agreed in the policy.
If accidental damage coverage with us applies to both a towing vehicle and a trailer and both are affected by an insured event at the same time, only the higher deductible applies.  
**A10.2 The deductible does not apply:**  
**A10.2.1 Liability**
- if we are required to pay benefits even though the insured is not at fault (simple causal liability)
- in the event of joyriding (pursuant to the Road Traffic Act), provided that the keeper is not at fault for the misappropriation of the vehicle  
**A10.2.2 Accidental damage**
- in the event of loss or damage for which a liable party or their insurer has paid liability compensation in full.

--- Chunk 7 ---
We may adjust the contract with effect from the following insurance year in the following cases:
- premium increase
- a change in the rules on deductibles
- a change in the no claims discount system
- insurance conditions
- contractual conditions  
**A11.1 Notice of any adjustment to the contract by us**  
Notice of any adjustment to the contract must be received by you no later than 25 days prior to the start of the new insurance year.  
**A11.2 Termination by you**  
You have the right to terminate that part of the contract affected by the change, or the entire contract, at the end of the current insurance year. At the end of the insurance year, those parts of the contract specified by you will end. Notice of termination must be received by us no later than on the last day of the current insurance year. Changes that do not entitle you to terminate are, among others:
- premiums or benefits in your favor
- fees, benefits or deductibles under coverage regulated by statute, if a federal authority prescribes them  
**A11.3 Consent to the adjustment to the contract**  
If you do not terminate the contract by the end of the insurance year, this will be deemed to constitute consent to the adjustment to the contract.

A12.6.1 Handling of legal cases
- Notify us immediately as soon as you need legal assistance. Send us all the documents relating to the legal case (e.g. contracts, correspondence, fine orders, summonses and rulings), and provide us with all the necessary information as well as powers of attorney.
- You will be advised and represented by our legal experts.
- If, in our view, it becomes necessary to involve an external lawyer, we will help you to select one and we will cover the costs incurred within the scope of the cost approval that was issued.
- You are free to choose your own lawyer in the following three cases:
- For court or administrative proceedings where a lawyer must be used
- If your opposing party is an AXA Group company (other than AXA-ARAG)
- If the legal case involved is one in which AXA-ARAG must also provide coverage to your opposing party  
If we reject the lawyer you selected, you can suggest three further lawyers. They may not belong to the same law firm. We must accept one of these three suggestions. In all these cases, we cover the costs within the scope of the cost approval that was issued.
- In connection with your legal case, you must release the lawyer you retained from attorney-client privilege in relation to us, and you must require the lawyer to keep us informed about the case. In addition, information that we require for our decisions must be provided to us, and relevant documents must be made available to us.
- You must obtain our consent before you retain a lawyer, commence court proceedings or conclude a settlement for which we are supposed to cover costs or accept any other obligations.
- If you are in breach of any duties to provide information or any rules of conduct, we may reduce or deny benefits. We will not do so if, under the circumstances, the breach was beyond your control or if you can prove that the legal case did not arise as a result of it, and that the amount of the benefits owed was not affected.
- Instead of the insured benefits, we may pay all or part of the amount in dispute to you (buyout of claim). In this case, we take into consideration your risk of litigation and collection risk. In addition, we can have the benefits paid through an external service provider (e.g. lawyer).
- We accept no liability either for the choice and engagement of a lawyer or any other auxiliary persons (e.g. interpreter, expert, etc.). Furthermore, we accept no liability for the prompt communication of information or transfer of cash payments.  
A12.6.2 Procedure in case of differences of opinion
- A difference of opinion arises if we consider a legal case to be futile or if you do not agree with us about the measures for dealing with your legal case. In this event, you have the right to have your chances of success assessed by an independent expert to be designated jointly. Within 20 days of receiving our letter setting out the reasons, you must ask us in writing to initiate dispute resolution proceedings; if we do not hear from you, you will be deemed to have waived this option. From the date of our letter, you yourself are responsible for meeting the deadlines in your legal case.
- If you request dispute resolution proceedings, we must each pay one half of the costs in advance, and the costs will ultimately be borne by the unsuccessful party. In these proceedings, no legal expenses are awarded to the opposing party.

In addition to the insured vehicles specified in the policy, the insurance also covers vehicles and trailers that are pushed or pulled by these vehicles.

---  
## C10 Benefits in the event of a claim  
### C10.1 Repairs
We pay the costs for the repair of the vehicle within the limits of its present value as well as the optional equipment and accessories, unless the event involves a total loss as defined in C10.2. Compensation may be made contingent on the repair actually being carried out. If faulty maintenance, wear and tear or prior damage have led to increased repair costs, or if the repair has improved the condition of the vehicle, you must pay the corresponding share of these costs. We are under no obligation to pay for a new replacement if it is possible to fully repair the damaged components. The insurance pays the present value for damaged tires. If repairs are not carried out on recreational vehicles or travel trailers in the event of a claim, we will only compensate for depreciation in accordance with the guidelines of the Schweizerischer Caravangewerbe-Verband SGCV (Swiss Camping Industry Association). Any agreed deductible will be subtracted from the calculated damage.  
### C10.2 Total loss
There is a total loss if:
- the repair costs exceed the present value
- for the compensation type "present value supplement" or "purchase price guarantee," the repair costs exceed 60 % of the value of the vehicle during the first two years in operation
- a stolen vehicle or stolen optional equipment and accessories have not been found within 30 days of the theft being reported to one of our Swiss branch offices
- a misappropriated vehicle could not be recovered within two months of the filing of a criminal complaint  
The calculation of the benefits depends on the type of compensation agreed (purchase price guarantee, present value supplement or present value).  
#### C10.2.1 Purchase price guarantee
100 % of the purchase price will be paid in compensation for the first five years following the purchase of the vehicle. In the case of new vehicles, the date on which they are first registered applies and in the case of used vehicles, the acquisition date on the purchase agreement applies. Thereafter, compensation is paid in accordance with the present value supplement (C10.2.2) plus 10 % thereof. In the event of a claim, you must be able to substantiate the purchase price by submitting the purchase agreement. The purchase price is understood to be the amount listed at the time of the handover to the keeper, after deduction of all discounts. This amount may not differ substantially from the price for comparable vehicles (age and condition) at the time of the purchase of the vehicle. If the purchase price cannot be substantiated, or if it differs significantly from that for comparable vehicles at the time of the purchase of the vehicle, compensation is paid in accordance with the present value (C10.2.3).  
#### C10.2.2 Present value supplement  
| Time in operation | Insured vehicle value, in % |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| in year 1         | 100                         |
| in year 2         | 100                         |
| in year 3         | 90 – 80                     |
| in year 4         | 80 – 70                     |
| in year 5         | 70 – 60                     |
| in year 6         | 60 – 50                     |
| in year 7         | 50 – 40                     |
| from year 8, present value plus 10 % thereof |  
The benefits are reduced commensurately after an assessment by an expert if a lack of maintenance, wear and tear, or pre-existing damage more likely contributed to the total loss. If the actual purchase price was less than the benefits calculated in this manner, the purchase price will be paid, but no less than the present value. If the purchase price cannot be substantiated, only the present value is compensated. Any agreed deductible and the salvage value will only be deducted afterwards.  
#### C10.2.3 Present value
The benefits are limited to the present value.  
#### C10.2.4 Additional basis for the calculation of benefits
1. **Salvage value**
In the case of a total loss, the benefits are reduced by the salvage value of the vehicle. If this value is not deducted, the scrap becomes our property as soon as the benefits have been paid. If a misappropriated vehicle or individual optional equipment and accessories are compensated as a total loss, the rights of ownership are transferred to us.  
2. **Value added tax**
Claims payments to taxpayers who are able to deduct input tax are disbursed without value added tax. Claims payments based on provisional estimates of repair costs do not include value added tax.  
3. **Leasing/assignment**
In the case of leased vehicles, any difference (gap) between the claim of the lessor and our compensation is also insured. In this case, the benefit is limited to the difference between the residual value and our calculation of compensation. The benefit will only be paid if "present value supplement" or "purchase price guarantee" was agreed.  
If we are aware of any payments under the accidental damage policy for the insured vehicle that have been assigned to the assignee (in particular to the lessor or lender), the following applies:
- In the case of a total loss, we indemnify the assignee;
- in the case of a partial loss, we indemnify the party that carried out the repair and invoiced it
- We may notify the assignee about any outstanding premiums
- If we provide benefits, we are not required to verify if the assignment still exists
- You waive any claim against us if our payments to the assignee are higher than their claims against you  
---  
Motor Vehicle Insurance. GIC Version 10.2023 15

- the recovery and transport to the nearest suitable repair shop as well as customs clearance of up to CHF 10 000
- if necessary, return transportation to Switzerland of up to CHF 1 000
